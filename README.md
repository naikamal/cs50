# CS50 Project 0

Welcome to my CS50 project repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects I've completed as part of the edX CS50 course. The projects included here involve HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

I've created three HTML files, each showcasing a different aspect of Google's functionality:

1. **Google Basic Search:** This simple webpage demonstrates a basic Google search interface.
2. **Google Image Search:** Explore this webpage to see a Google image search in action.
3. **Google Advanced Search:** Dive into this webpage to experience a more advanced Google search with four input fields.

To maintain consistency and style across all three HTML files, I've used a single CSS file named "style.css." This stylesheet is linked to each HTML file, ensuring a cohesive visual experience.

## Styling

The project is styled using the "style.css" file, which provides a uniform appearance for all webpages. The font size for the heading "CS50 Project 0" has been adjusted to ensure a visually appealing presentation.

## How It Works

For each webpage, I've leveraged Google's existing form design by incorporating query strings and parameters. This approach optimizes efficiency and replicates the Google search functionality seamlessly.

## References

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly showcase, demonstrating fundamental HTML and CSS concepts. During the development process, I consulted Google's documentation for styling elements and utilized ChatGPT for assistance with query string parameters.The purpose iof this project is  just design the google pages.
